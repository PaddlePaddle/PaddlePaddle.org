<h1>Running a program<a class="headerlink" href="#running-a-program" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>While programs using the PaddlePaddle API are written in Python, their intermediate representations (IRs) are actually handed off and executed by C++ code optimized to make the most of the hardware resources available.</p>
<p>This execution flow runs all the operators generated by your Python code in a sequence, for each batch (or epoch) of data that you feed in.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Two interesting things to note here:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>To keep things consistent and understandable, PaddlePaddle adds several backward propagation operators at the end of the program, corresponding to the gradient calculation logic for each of the differentiable operators.</li>
<li>Aspects of the network that are not plain “feedforward”, such as <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network">Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</a>, are run in a custom subsections of the network called “blocks” (yes, the same idea as the regular programming idea of blocks), and they have their own mechanism and order of running the sub-operators they depend on.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In the case of a training run, the sequence, in order, is something similar to the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Operators that take in any attributes that you wish to <cite>feed</cite> to the network.</li>
<li>Operators that read your input data.</li>
<li>A pass through the <strong>forward</strong> operators.</li>
<li>A pass through the <strong>backward propagation / gradient calculation</strong> operators.</li>
<li>Operators that return any variables you sought to <cite>fetch</cite> back from the program, to print or perhaps analyze them.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s as straightforward as that.</p>

<h2>Overview of PaddlePaddle’s IR<a class="headerlink" href="#overview-of-paddlepaddle-s-ir" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PaddlePaddle’s IRs, <cite>ProgramDesc</cite>s, are more of a serialized (using protobuf) general software program, than anything else. Just like programs written in your favorite programming language, they contain variables, a sequence of operators (since every statement contains some sort of operation), and blocks (yes, the things under <cite>if</cite>s, <cite>while</cite>s, <cite>function</cite>s, and other control flow syntax).</p>

<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="first admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p class="last">Blocks also allow PaddlePaddle to support control flow like <cite>if/else</cite>, <cite>while</cite>, <cite>switch</cite>, and in the cases of concurrency, <cite>select</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">In the case of operators, there are 3 kinds of arguments. Configurations passed into the operators in your Python code become <em>attributes</em>, while data flowing into and out of the operator become its <em>inputs</em> and <em>outputs</em>.</p>
