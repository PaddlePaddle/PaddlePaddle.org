# About us

## What is PaddlePaddle
 
 - PaddlePaddle is an open source deep learning framework provided by Baidu that enables developers and companies to implement their AI ideas safely and quickly.
 - The team brings together the world's top deep learning scientists to provide developers and companies with the best deep learning experience
 - The framework has four characteristics: easy to learn, easy to use, safe and efficient. It is the most suitable learning tool for Chinese developers and companies.

## Technical features of PaddlePaddle

 - A new generation of deep learning frameworks: PaddlePaddle is a new generation of deep learning framework based on "deep learning programming language". While maintaining a competitive performance, it greatly enhances the framework's ability to express models and can describe any potential models that may appear.
 - More friendly to large-scale calculations: PaddlePaddle excels in distributed computing through a variety of large-scale computing operations within Baidu. By using EDL technology, it can save a lot of computing resources, and can also support the training of large-scale sparse models.
 - Provides a visualization tool for Deep Learning: Visual DL helps developers easily observe overall training performance and statistics data, such as accuracy/loss metrics, parameter distribution, image/audio sampling and model graph via ONNX. It is an efficient tool to help developers to more easily debug and develop on a deep learning framework.


## PaddlePaddle-based education system

 - Deep learning courses: Baidu partnered with top education and training institutions in China to develop high-quality learning courses and learning materials to help developers master in deep learning with no prior experience.
 - Deep learning online development tool: For users who are interested in scientific research and learning, PaddlePaddle provides a online development environment that requires no installation. The tool provides algorithms, calculations, and data support.
 - Face to face training: Organize enriched and interactive learning opportunity, such as in-class tutorial sessions, get-together meet ups, skill development bootcamps and other professional development opportunities for participants.

## PaddlePaddle-based AI service

 - EasyDL: It can help companies with no algorithms knowledge to quickly complete a deep learning task with only a small amount of data to get a good model.
 - AI Market: Provides standardized AI capabilities and product trading mechanisms to help companies quickly find the right AI business.
 - Deep Learning Contest: PaddlePaddle brings together top-notch deep learning developer in a community where companies can publish their own business issues, quickly find the optimal solution through competition.
